# my-code-quiz-app by Luc Tourangeau

The goal of this challenge was to create a trivia app with the following features:
* Track user score (time left on a timer upon completing the quiz)
* A game is over when the time left reaches zero OR the user answers all questions
* At the end of the game or upon clicking a "view highscores" button, view the user's score on a highscore board (if the score was high enough)
* Use localStorage to store and retrieve user scores

A demonstration of the app in-use:
